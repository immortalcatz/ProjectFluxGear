##Licensing

####Project Flux Gear is copyleft under the What is Mortvana Even Saying License:

The code of Project Flux Gear in source and/or binary is the intellectual property of Team Magnequasar (Mortvana, MasterAbdoTGM50, Drullkus, and Gyro [Glassmaker, TheMike, Blorph, and Tiktalik get a mention too]). The end user (From here on know as "You") may not reproduce or modify Project Flux Gear for public distribution without prior permission. You can however redistribute official Project Flux Gear compiled binaries in modpacks with adequate permissions for other mods to be included. Any modpack using Project Flux Gear takes **full** responsibility for user support queries, and the **MODPACK TEAM** should report bugs to us. For anyone else, we only support official builds from the main CI servers, or from CurseForge, not custom built jars. We also do not take bug reports for outdated versions of Minecraft. You are allowed to fork and modify Project Flux Gear, and submit Pull Requests, and even port it if the whole team happens to spontaneously implode and/or drop the project and/or wont updated to the horrible place called 1.8. You can copy portions of code for use in other projects, or even use our (Team Magnequasar's) code as a dependency for other mods. Any contributions to this repository are automatically licensed under this license, so if you don't agree with it, you shouldn't contribute. Any code heavily copied from, derived from, or building on our code must be publicly visible; You keep rights to your OWN code, but you still must make your source visible. You are forbidden from claiming any code, which you did not write as your own. Also, just use common sense and follow Wheaton's Law.

#### In Human Readable Text:

- Project Flux Gear's code in any form belongs to Team Magnequasar.
- You may not publicly distribute unofficial Project Flux Gear binaries without permission.
- Go ahead and use Project Flux Gear in **OFFICIAL** modpacks (a modpack permissions to include all mods included) or private modpacks (packs which have closed access). A Dropbox folder with friends, an FTB Private Pack with a SECRET [READ: Not posted ANYWHERE public], etc. count as private packs.
- Any modpack using Project Flux Gear must handle bug reports first.
- Don't report bugs for outdated (not the version of the LATEST STABLE build) versions of Minecraft,
- You can fork, modify, and make pull requests.
- You can copy portions of the code, and are encouraged to learn from it.
- Anything submitted is automatically licensed under this license.
- Any code largely based on our code must be publicly visible, but you still own it.
- You can't claim any code here as your own, unless it actually is.
- Most importantly, you MUST follow Wheaton's Law; Don't be a Dick [appending Cheney is optional] (Or a cork soaker, a Greggy-Greg, etc.)

If you have queries about any license or the above support restrictions, drop by our IRC channel, #MortTech on irc.esper.net

##Legal Stuff

-As per terms of the Railcraft licence, I must state that I have used Railcraft code in creating the Poor Ores, all code from Railcraft is marked as such in the class.
