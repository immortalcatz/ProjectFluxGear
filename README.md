#Project Flux Gear

# Project Flux Gear is on hold indefinately, I hope to be able to actually get back into Minecraft once I graduate this June. -Mortvana

##Compiling from Source
Note: Git MUST be installed and in the system path to use our scripts.
* Setup: Run [gradle]in the repository root: `gradlew[.bat] [setupDevWorkspace|setupDecompWorkspace] [eclipse|idea]`
* Build: Run [gradle]in the repository root: `gradlew[.bat] build`
* If obscure Gradle issues are found try running `gradlew clean` and `gradlew cleanCache`

##Plans

I'm working on cleaning them up, along with the code. They will be done soon... (tm)... Valve Time...

##Issue reporting
Please include the following:

* Minecraft version
* Forge version/build

##Licensing

####Project Flux Gear is copyfree under the What is Mortvana Even Saying License:

The code of Project Flux Gear in source and/or binary is the intellectual property of The Flux Tinkers (Mortvana, MasterAbdoTGM50, and Drullkus (Glassmaker, Gyro, TheMike, Blorph, MysteriousAges, and Tiktalik get a mention too, as they are honorary members)). The end user (From here on know as "You") may not reproduce or modify Project Flux Gear for public distribution without prior permission. You can however redistribute official Project Flux Gear compiled binaries in modpacks with adequate permissions for other mods to be included. Any modpack using Project Flux Gear takes **full** responsibility for user support queries, and the **MODPACK TEAM** should report bugs to us (if you can properly report a bug, go ahead :P). For anyone else, we only support official builds from the main CI servers, or from CurseForge, not custom built jars. We also do not take bug reports for outdated versions of Minecraft. You are allowed to fork and modify Project Flux Gear, and submit Pull Requests, and even port it if the whole team happens to spontaneously implode and/or drop the project and/or wont updated to the horrible place called C++, I (Mortvana) mean 1.8. You can copy portions of code for use in other projects, or even use our (Team Magnequasar's) code as a dependency for other mods. Any contributions to this repository are automatically licensed under this license, so if you don't agree with it, you probably shouldn't contribute. Any code heavily copied from, derived from, or building on our code must be publicly visible; You keep rights to your OWN code, but you still should make your source visible (Honestly, you should do that either way :P). You are forbidden from claiming any code, which you did not write as your own. Also, just use common sense and follow Wheaton's Law.

#### In Human Readable Text:

- Project Flux Gear's code in any form (even genetic) belongs to Team Magnequasar.
- You may not publicly distribute unofficial Project Flux Gear binaries without permission from the "All-derping Fluxlord of Cheese and Potatoes", "The Thaumic Methcook", "Abdildo the Mighty", "Sir Not Gyro the Hipster Fractal Cat of Being Eaten by Grues", or their henchmen.
- Go ahead and use Project Flux Gear in **OFFICIAL** modpacks (a modpack permissions to include all mods included) or private modpacks (packs which have closed access). A Dropbox folder with friends, an FTB Private Pack with a SECRET (READ: Not posted ANYWHERE public), etc., count as private packs.
- Any modpack using Project Flux Gear must handle bug reports first.
- Don't report bugs for outdated (not the version of the LATEST STABLE build) versions of Minecraft.
- You can fork, modify, and make pull requests.
- You can copy portions of the code, and are encouraged to learn from it.
- Anything submitted is automatically licensed under this license, because legal bullshit.
- Any code largely based on our code **really should** be publicly visible, but you still own it.
- You can't claim any code here as your own, unless it actually is.
- Most importantly, you MUST follow Wheaton's Law; Don't be a Dick (appending Cheney is optional) (Also don't be a cork soaker, a Greggy-Greg, etc.)
- Always remember to end one sentence per README with a comma,

If you have queries about any license, or the above support restrictions, or my cat, or whatever, drop by our IRC channel, #ProjectFluxGear on irc.esper.net :P

##Legal Bullshit

- So no-one gets their kilt stuck in a jet engine about any license change or whatever, all code submitted is automagically licensed under my random licensing stuff, which shall always follow Wheaton's Law :P
- As per terms of the Railcraft licence, I must state that I have used Railcraft code in creating the Poor Ores, all code originally from Railcraft is marked as such in the class.
